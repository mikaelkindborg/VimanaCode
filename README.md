# VimanaLang

DIY interpreter for a dynamic language influenced by Lisp and Forth.

Current implementation is written in PHP.

See comments and code examples in file [workbench.php](https://github.com/mikaelkindborg/VimanaLang/blob/master/workbench.php) for how to get started.

Also see header comment in [interpreter.php](https://github.com/mikaelkindborg/VimanaLang/blob/master/interpreter.php).

Run on your local machine in a console window:

    php workbench.php

I created VimanaLang as an experiment, for the fun of it. I am on old Lisp programmer and in school I had a Hewlett & Packard calculator with Reverse Polish Notation. Sweet memories. This is a retro project.
