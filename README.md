# VimanaLang

DIY interpreter for a dynamic language influenced by Lisp and Forth.

Current implementation is written in PHP.

See comments in the file workbench.php for how to get started.

Also see header comment in interpreter.php.

Run on your local machine in a comsole window:

php workbench.php

I created VimanaLang as an experiment, for the fun of it. I am on old Lisp programmer and in school I had a Hewlett & Packard calculator with Reverse Polish Notation. Sweet memories. This is a retro project.
