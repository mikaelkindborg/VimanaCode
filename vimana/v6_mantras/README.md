# Mantra Web App

Here are two examples of mantra web apps.

One shows the mantra of the day, and the other shows the mantra of now.

## Language Properties

These examples illustrate several interesting programming language properties.

Programs contain data and code. Both have the same representation.

## Comparison with Lisp

Opposites compared with Lisp:

- Things first vs. actions first (postfix actions vs prefix actions)

- Function calling vs. message sending syntax (PN vs RPN)

- Eval by default vs. quote by default (functions and arguments)

Similarities with Lisp:

- Data and code have the same representation (lists)

- The code IS the (abstract) syntax tree (AST)

In both Vimana and Lisp, you code directly in the syntax tree. 

A graphical block editor would be very strightforward, for example, and even more so for Vimana which has an even more simplistic syntax.

## Minimalism/Simplicity to the Extreme

Interesting code formatting possibilities. Layout of long code sequences.

Parsing is very easy.

Only reserved symbols are left paren and right paren, and whitespace.

Parens group, whitespace separates.

## Properties of RPN

All problems with grouping goes away!

The mental model is interesting.

You put your stuf on the table and the decide how to assemble it. This brings flexibility, since you can more freely change the components and it makes them clearly visible in the syntax since they come first.

This is similar to object-oriented programming and message passing, which also has a syntax where the object comes first.
